It happens to the best of us, we open TikTok, Reels, YouTube Shorts, just to pass time for 5/10 minutes, but end up spending hours on brain-rot doom scroll race for most of the free time on our hands. Constant nudging of 30 seconds of low effort flashy content activates our brain's reward center, and we keep on craving more dopamine in the form of staying more on these digital platforms.

As we spend more time on non-productive doom-scrolling, more and more dopamine is released as response to the shorts videos. The time goes by, and dopamine resistance is produced, as a cause, we need to spend more time on these short platforms to get the same level of hit. The dopamine hit which we use to get just by spending 5/10 minutes on these platforms in the beginning.

The same is true for all the social media platforms which are in the arms race of getting our attention. The more time we spend there, the more we get sunk in the algorithmic rabbit-hole. These social media platforms deploy some scary dystopian "dark magic" techniques to fight for our attention and time. We live in the attention economy, where we bombarded with the "free" content, whom we pay for, with our data and time.

## Why Should I Care?

Though in the intro, I went over this, but still some people will be like, I don't get sunk. I just spend some of my free time to refresh my mind and then get back to the real-life. I'm not addicted to social media or doom-scrolling dystopia. So, WHY SHOULD I CARE?

If you are not addicted, then congratulations, you are one in millions who have defeated the attention economy. You are immune to millions and millions of dollars of research aimed at getting into our heads. You can stop reading here and get back to your life, if nobody around you likes of your friends and family has caught themselves into the machine trap. But if your family and friends don't have iron curtains around their heads like you, you will definitely learn a thing or two in this blog to help them, get out of the attention trap.

## The Machine Trap!

In this day and age, the most precious and important thing every human being has is their attention. The companies compete fiercely for it and try to outrun each other in getting our exposure.

The attention generates digital footprints which can be sold to the advertisers for profit. To maximize the profit, they need to get more of our attention. So, they deploy more "Dark Sci-Fi" methods to keep us engaged on their platforms.

The people who give in to the algorithms, will soon find themselves in the echo chamber, where they don't hear the opposite opinions at all. That's definitely intentional on the algorithm's part, as they are designed to feed the narrative you are most likely to engaged with.

Once you're trapped, not only you've paid the price with your data but also through your social and business circles. In the real life, when you will meet someone, and talk about some topic. You will most likely feel discontent while listening to other person's thoughts which don't align with your reasoning. In the process, you may lose not only the prospective good friends but also good clients.
