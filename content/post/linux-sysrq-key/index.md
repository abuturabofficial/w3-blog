We all remembered the classic blue screen of death on Windows, I still get its nightmares too ðŸ¥². And we all escaped to Linux. But over here, everything isn't sunshine and rainbows either.

Sometimes your system gets locked up, and no <kbd>key</kbd> input or `tty` terminal works. At this time, your only hope left, to gracefully shutdown/reboot the system is **Magic SysRq Key**.

## Magic SysRq Key

It's a command consisting of key combinations which works at low level regardless of your system state, to recover your computer from **freezes** or to **reboot/shutdown** it, without corrupting the filesystem. <kbd>SysRq</kbd> aggressively remount the filesystem, terminate/kills the system processes and writes the unwritten data to the disk.

You can power off your system using the <button>Hardware RESET</button> button on your PC, but this doesn't make sure your filesystem/OS gets powered down elegantly.

<kbd>SysRq</kbd> key doesn't work when there is a kernel panic or hardware failure. Honestly, You have got bigger problems than smoothly shutting down your PC.

## Requirements

- Have `root/sudo` access
- Kernel compiled with `CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ` kernel parameter (All mainstream distros has this feature built-in)
- <kbd>SysRq</kbd> or <kbd>PrtSc</kbd> key on your <kbd>QWERTY</kbd> keyboard
- On some systems/Laptops, you may need to hold <kbd>Fn</kbd> key during invoke process

## Configuration

> [!caution]
> The various combinations of the `SysRq` command are possible. We will proceed with `176` as a normal user, that's enough to effortlessly reboot/shutdown the frozen system. Do your due diligence to enable advanced functionality, as it can **arguably** weaken system security if it is a multi-access or modem attached system.
> 
> **See the [References](#references) section for more study guides on alleged security concerns.**

Check what value for `SysRq` is currently set:

```bash
cat /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
```

> [!TIP]
> `0` means SysRq is disabled, `1` means all features are enabled.

We will set the `SysRq` value to <u>176</u>. The value 176 corresponds to specific SysRq functions enabled in the Linux kernel. It is calculated as follows:
-  **128**: Allow reboot/poweroff
- **32**: Enable remounting filesystems as read-only
- **16**: Enable sync command

Thus, 128+32+16=176 allows these functionalities while disabling others

Edit this file `/etc/sysctl.d/90-sysrq.conf` (need sudo privileges) using your favorite text editor and add this line:

```text
kernel.sysrq = 176
```

To apply these changes immediately:

```bash
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/90-sysrq.conf
```

To verify, changes have been applied:

```bash
cat /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
```

The output should be <u>**176**</u>.

The configuration done this way, will persist across reboots.


## SysRq Usage

When your system becomes unresponsive and doesn't react at all, do this:

- Press and hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> key
- Press <kbd>Fn</kbd> + <kbd>PrtSc</kbd> OR <kbd>SysRq</kbd> keys, and release both while holding <kbd>Alt</kbd> key and press:
  - <kbd>s</kbd> to sync
  - <kbd>r</kbd> to remount
  - <kbd>e</kbd> to terminate the processes
  - <kbd>i</kbd> to kill the processes
  - <kbd>b</kbd> to reboot

That's how you can get back your locked/frozen system to life again, without using <button>Hardware RESET</button> button.
